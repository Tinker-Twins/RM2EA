# Rotation Matrix to Euler Angles (RM2EA)

`RM2EA` is a function defined to convert a standard 3 x 3 rotation matrix into its Euler angle (i.e. roll, pitch, yaw) equivalent. This function is based upon [Computing Euler angles from a rotation matrix](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/publications/euler.pdf) by Gregory G. Slabaugh.
